Troubleshooting
----------------------

Even those who follow this documentation precisely are bound to end up stuck at some point. This could be due to something unique to your system, a mistyped command, actions performed out of order, or even a typo in this guide. This section provides some tools to help diagnose the issue as well as some common errors that have been experienced and resolved before. If you get stuck, try re-reading the documentation again and after that, share what you've been working on, attempted steps to resolve, and other pertinent details in [#intend-to-bolus in Gitter](https://gitter.im/nightscout/intend-to-bolus) when asking for help troubleshooting. Here is also a [good blog post to read with tips on how to best seek help online to troubleshoot](https://diyps.org/2017/03/19/tips-for-troubleshooting-diy-diabetes-devices-openaps-or-otherwise/).
